This is the repository for the frontend of [deens.com](https://deens.com). This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) and then later moved over to [React app rewired](https://github.com/timarney/react-app-rewired).

## 🏗 Development

```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:deens-com/frontend.git
$ cd frontend

# install dependencies
$ yarn
```

We have some [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) specific code in our `package.json` so we recommend that you use [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) for package management with this repo.

```sh
# export the backend endpoint to use
$ export REACT_APP_PARSE_SERVER_URL=https://staging-api.deens.com

```

## :art: Style Guidelines

We use [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) to format the code for this repo.

Before committing, please run `yarn prettier-all` to format your code or add Prettier to the `pre-commit` hook to automatically take care of formatting.

#### How to add Prettier to pre-commit hook?

```sh
$ touch .git/hooks/pre-commit
$ chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
$ echo '''#!/usr/bin/env bash

yarn lint-staged''' > .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
